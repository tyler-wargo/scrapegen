# scrapegen
a Python program that scrapes websites for company names/descriptions; then puts the info into a Google Sheet

there is lots of information within the commented-out sections. I created this program to practice Python coding within a marketing/data analysis scope. 

if there's any issues with the code, keep in mind this is a beta program that's still in the process of creation.
